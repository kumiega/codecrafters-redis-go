This is a starting point for Go solutions to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, I will build a toy Redis clone capable of handling basic commands like PING,
SET, and GET. Through this project, I aim to improve my Go programming skills.
